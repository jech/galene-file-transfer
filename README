An implementation of Galene's peer-to-peer file transfer protocol for the
command line.

This is not required in order to transfer files: the file transfer
protocol is usually invoked from Galene's web interface.  However, it may
be convienient in order to transfer files larger than the browser can
handle, or in environments where a full web browser is not available.

# Building

    git clone https://github.com/jech/galene-file-transfer
    cd galene-file-transfer
    CGO_ENABLED=0 go build

# Sending files

    galene-file-transfer -to jch \
                         https://galene.org:8443/group/public/ \
                         filename

# Receiving files

    galene-file-transfer https://galene.org:8443/group/public/

The program will normally exit after one file transfer.  In order to
receive multiple files, use the `-persist` option.
